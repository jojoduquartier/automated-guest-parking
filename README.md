# Automating Guest Parking Registration

Simple and Straight Forward python script to automate guest parking registration at my apartment.

It's late December 2020 and guests will be visiting (Holiday Season!). To make this parking registration app slightly more fun, I used [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) to turn it into a real UI. Functionalities of this interface include:


1. Configure and update tenant information at any time
2. Register new guests and automatically save their profiles
3. Select a saved profile for quick registration and View, Update and Delete any profiles

Start | Finish
